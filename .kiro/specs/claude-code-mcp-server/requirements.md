# Requirements Document

## Introduction

This feature involves building a Model Context Protocol (MCP) server in Python that serves as a comprehensive coding AI assistant integrated with Claude Code. The MCP server will provide end-to-end coding capabilities including code writing, debugging, testing, research, and spec-driven development workflows. It will operate within Docker containers for isolation and support multiple LLM providers (Kimi-k2 via MoonShot AI official API and OpenAI o1-mini via OpenAI official API) with configurable API keys.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a developer using Claude Code, I want an MCP server that can perform comprehensive coding tasks, so that I can get end-to-end development assistance without switching between multiple tools.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server is invoked THEN it SHALL provide tools for code writing, code fixing, code debugging, and code testing
2. WHEN a coding task is requested THEN the system SHALL execute the task within isolated Docker containers
3. WHEN the MCP server completes a task THEN it SHALL document all actions in an agentJournal.md file
4. WHEN working with Python projects THEN the system SHALL create virtual environments before installing packages
5. WHEN working with Node.js projects THEN the system SHALL avoid global installations and use local package management

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to research latest documentation and best practices, so that I can ensure my code follows current standards and uses up-to-date approaches.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN research is needed THEN the system SHALL use context7 MCP to look up latest documentation
2. WHEN debugging issues THEN the system SHALL search the internet for fixes, best practices, bugs, and vulnerabilities
3. WHEN implementing solutions THEN the system SHALL incorporate researched best practices into the code
4. WHEN security concerns arise THEN the system SHALL research and implement security best practices

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to follow spec-driven development, so that I can have structured and well-planned development processes.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN starting a new feature THEN the system SHALL create requirements, design, and tasks specifications
2. WHEN specs are created THEN the system SHALL pass them back to Claude Code agent for confirmation or feedback
3. WHEN feedback is received THEN the system SHALL provide tools to edit and update the specifications
4. WHEN implementing features THEN the system SHALL follow the approved specifications strictly

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to handle integrations and credentials securely, so that I can work with APIs and databases safely during development and testing.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN API or database integration is required THEN the system SHALL ask Claude Code agent for available credentials
2. IF no credentials are available THEN the system SHALL create appropriate mocks for testing
3. WHEN credentials are provided THEN the system SHALL handle them securely within Docker containers
4. WHEN testing integrations THEN the system SHALL use isolated environments to prevent data contamination

### Requirement 5

**User Story:** As a developer, I want to configure which LLM providers to use, so that I can choose the best model for different types of coding tasks.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN setting up the MCP server THEN users SHALL be able to configure LLM provider choices (Kimi-k2 via MoonShot AI official API and/or OpenAI o1-mini via OpenAI official API)
2. WHEN configuring providers THEN users SHALL be able to set API keys via script or environment variables
3. WHEN multiple providers are configured THEN the system SHALL allow switching between models based on task requirements
4. WHEN using LLM APIs THEN the system SHALL use official API endpoints and documentation from OpenAI and MoonShot AI
5. WHEN API keys are invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages and fallback options

### Requirement 6

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to maintain high code quality standards, so that all generated code is well-documented, organized, and maintainable.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN generating code THEN the system SHALL ensure all code is well-documented with appropriate comments
2. WHEN structuring projects THEN the system SHALL follow established architectural patterns and avoid spaghetti code
3. WHEN creating functions THEN the system SHALL include proper type hints, error handling, and documentation
4. WHEN organizing code THEN the system SHALL follow language-specific best practices and conventions

### Requirement 7

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to ask clarification questions when uncertain, so that I can provide guidance and ensure accurate implementation.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN requirements are ambiguous THEN the system SHALL ask specific clarification questions
2. WHEN multiple implementation approaches exist THEN the system SHALL present options and ask for preference
3. WHEN external dependencies are needed THEN the system SHALL confirm before installation
4. WHEN making architectural decisions THEN the system SHALL explain reasoning and seek approval

### Requirement 8

**User Story:** As a developer, I want the MCP server to be implemented in Python with proper architecture, so that it can be easily maintained and extended.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing the MCP server THEN it SHALL be built using Python with proper package structure
2. WHEN integrating with LLM APIs THEN it SHALL use the official OpenAI Python SDK and MoonShot AI official API endpoints
3. WHEN handling dependencies THEN it SHALL use virtual environments and requirements.txt for package management
4. WHEN structuring the codebase THEN it SHALL follow Python best practices with proper modules, classes, and type hints

### Requirement 9

**User Story:** As a developer, I want comprehensive logging and documentation of all MCP server activities, so that I can track progress and understand what actions were taken.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the MCP server starts a task THEN it SHALL create or update an agentJournal.md file
2. WHEN actions are performed THEN the system SHALL log detailed information about each step
3. WHEN errors occur THEN the system SHALL document the error, attempted fixes, and resolution
4. WHEN tasks complete THEN the system SHALL provide a summary of all actions taken and results achieved
